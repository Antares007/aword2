## ON ACTIONABLE NUMBERS, WITH AN APPLICATION TO THE ENTSCHEIDUNGSPROBLEM

This paper presents the implementation and definition of the Notandor n-machine.
In Alan Turing's seminal work, ["ON COMPUTABLE NUMBERS, WITH AN APPLICATION TO
THE ENTSCHEIDUNGSPROBLEM"](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf)
such a machine is referenced in Chapter 2, "2. Definitions" as choice machines or c-machines.

The Notandor n-machine ensures decisiveness when processing ambiguous configurations,
offering a novel approach to managing uncertainty within computational frameworks.
